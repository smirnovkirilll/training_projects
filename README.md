<strong>Kirill Smirnov, junior python developer</strong>

I am junior programmer (python, math), linux and bash user, with strong background in software development management (since 2011 in IT as business analyst and project manager).

Current occupation is about working around with big data in marketing startup. That is under NDA, so in this repo just my old scripts, which i supposed were helpful to train. Repo contains small automation scripts and algorythmic tasks easy to show (which are not really useful or complex or can say enough about my current skills level).

Besides i have playground flask application, i develope while learning this framework:
[flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com](http://flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com), it uses:
- MVC-paradigm (views apart from models),
- Blueprints (flask-way of code organizing),
- SQLAlchemy for models generating,
- Bootstrap stuff, some side-services (like draw.io, pygal) to enrich content with visual component.

If you speak russian and interested in my BA-PM services, some info in this repo too, right [here](https://github.com/smirnovkirilll/training_projects/blob/master/ba_pm.md)
