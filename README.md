Hello!

This repo is for my training projects only, it's very unlikely you can find here something really useful. Unless you want to estimate my current developer skills.
I hope repo can help people, interested in colloboration with (or hiring) me, to better understand: what i can do and what i can't. Besides, it will motivate me to not stop learning and practicing.

Besides this repo, containing small automation scripts and algorythmic tasks (everything solved by myself, no cheating), a have two websites:

[flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com](http://flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com){:target="_blank"} - flask application, i develope while learning this beatiful framework,
[smirnovkirilll.github.io/](http://smirnovkirilll.github.io/){:target="_blank"} - even simpler app, where i tell about my current occupation (business analysis, automation mostly).
