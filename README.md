In this repo i'm gonna hold some tasks and projects, representing my current developer skills. I hope this will help people, interested in colloboration with (or hiring) me, to better understand: what i can do and what i can't. Besides, it will motivate me to not stop learning and practicing.


All tasks solved by myself, no cheating.
