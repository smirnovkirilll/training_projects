Hello!

My name is Kirill and i am junior python developer, linux and bash user, with strong background in software development management (5 years as BA and PM).

This repo is for my training projects only, it's very unlikely you can find here something really useful. But i hope repo can help people, interested in colloboration with (or hiring) me, to better understand what technologies i use. It contains small automation scripts and algorythmic tasks easy to show, for now my dev-level is little higher.

Besides i have two websites:
[flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com](http://flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com) - flask application, i develope while learning this beatiful framework, it uses:
- MVC-paradigm (views leaves away from models),
- Blueprints (flask-way of best code organization),
- SQLAlchemy for models generating,
- Bootstrap stuff, some side-services (like draw.io, pygal) to full pages with reach content.
[smirnovkirilll.github.io](http://smirnovkirilll.github.io) - simple app, where i tell about my current occupation (business analysis, automation mostly).

Feel free to contact me if i can help you.
