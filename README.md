<strong>Kirill Smirnov - Data Engineer, Software Developer</strong>

I have been working in IT for more than 6 years:
- 2016 - present - full-time programmer at geomarketing startup,
- 2011 - 2016 - business-analyst, IT project manager at advertisement, e-commerce (inhouse software development).

My current role is a member of the team preparing business insights for our clients on a base of geospatial data. I'm focusing on data munging, such as: html-parsing, cleaning, transforming, storing in databases, building mathematical models etc.

Python is my primary development language; bash, C - secondary ones.  
Databases I'm working with: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite.  
Statistics, linear algebra are in common usage (as well as pandas, numpy packages).  
Realizing potential business value of machine learning, I'm going to study it in 2018 year.

This repo contains my old scripts (small automation and algorythmic tasks), which i supposed to be helpful to get job offer a year ago (and had helped). But please note: it says not so much about my current skills level. Due to certain legal requirements, commercial projects as well as parts of them can't be placed here.

Also i have playground flask [application](https://flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com), i developed while learning this framework. There you can see:
- MVC-paradigm (views apart from models),
- Blueprints (flask-way of code organizing),
- SQLAlchemy for models generating,
- Bootstrap stuff, some side-services (like draw.io, pygal) to enrich content with visual components.
