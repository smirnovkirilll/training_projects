<strong>Kirill Smirnov - Data Engineer, Software Developer</strong>

I have been working in IT since 2011:
- 2017 - present - programmer at BigData division of a telecom company,
- 2016 - 2017 - programmer at geomarketing startup (as a member of the team preparing business insights for clients on a base of geospatial data. Focusing on data munging, such as: html-parsing, cleaning, transforming, storing in databases, implementing mathematical models into real code etc),
- 2011 - 2016 - business-analyst, IT project manager at advertisement, e-commerce (inhouse software development).  

My current role is about developing software applicable to BigData production solutions (Hadoop ecosystem, MPP databases).  

Python is my primary development language; bash, C - secondary ones.  
Databases I'm working with: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Hive.  

For now this repo contains only my outdated scripts (small automation and algorythmic tasks), which i supposed to be helpful to get job offer a couple years ago (and had helped). But please note: it says not so much about my current skills level. Due to certain legal requirements, commercial projects as well as parts of them can't be placed here.  

Also i have playground flask [application](https://flaskcombine-smirnovkirilll.rhcloud.com), i developed while learning this framework. There you can see:
- MVC-paradigm (views apart from models),
- Blueprints (flask-way of code organizing),
- SQLAlchemy for models generating,
- Bootstrap stuff, some side-services (like draw.io, pygal) to enrich content with visual components.
